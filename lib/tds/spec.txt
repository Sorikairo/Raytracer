Tiwind Data System (TDS) Specification
======================================

Tiwind Data System consists of two types of files : TDS and TCS files.
TDS files are code written and readable by the human, while TCS are compiled for
faster reading by a program.



1. General information

1.1. Blocks
TDS is structured in blocks.
They are the "skeleton" of a TDS file. They are the holder of every single
variable contained in the file, because it is impossible to declare any variable
outside of a block.
A block consists of two elements:
- a name, that isn't necessarely unique. The name of the block is used for
  identifing that block.
- a list of variables (see below). Please note that a block doesn't have a
  limited number of variables, and that it can have no variable in the list.

1.2. Variables
The notion of "variable" in TDS is basically the same as a lot of programming
languages: a variable is used for storing an information.
A variable consists of three elements:
- its type (see below for a list of standard ones)
- a name, that MUST be unique inside the block the variable is stored in
- a value, that is structured differently depending on the type

1.3. Type list
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| TYPE NAME | TYPE ID | TYPE SIZE |             SHORT DESCRIPTION             |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| BLOCK     |    1    |  NO SIZE  | Special type, marks block beginning       |
| BLOCK_END |    2    |  NO SIZE  | Special type, marks block end             |
| INT8      |    8    |     1     | 8-bit integer                             |
| INT16     |    9    |     2     | 16-bit integer                            |
| INT32     |   10    |     4     | 32-bit integer                            |
| STR       |   11    |  VARYING  | Ascii string                              |
| FLT32     |   12    |     4     | 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point number     |
| FLT64     |   13    |     8     | 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point number     |

2. TDS File Structure

A TDS file must be a text file. A single LF character must be used for new lines
and spaces and tabulations are ignored during the reading of the file.

2.1. Block
Blocks are the only thing that may be defined directly in the file.
A block always starts with with "BLOCK block_name", block_name being the name of
the block. block_name MUST be an ascii string.
Some variables then may be written into the block, until the end of the block is
declarated by the keyword "END_BLOCK".

2.2. Variable
A variable MUST be defined inside a block. Only one variable by line is allowed.
A variable must be defined using the following syntax:
"TYPE variable_name = [value]", TYPE being a correct type, variable_name being
the name of the variable, written in an ascii string, and [value] being the
value of the variable, following the TDS format of the type.



3. TCS File Structure

A TCS file must be a binary file, stored in little endian. A TCS file always
starts with the magic number 1413698346, coded on 4 bytes.

3.1. Block
Like TDS, blocks are the only thing allowed directly in the file after the
magic number.
They start with the BLOCK type id, coded on one byte, and the name of the block
(See 3.3).
A block ends with the BLOCK_END type id, coded on one byte as well.

3.2. Variable
A variable MUST be defined inside a block.
A variable
